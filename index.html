        <h3>What is a CodeImage?</h3>
        <br />
        A codeimage is an image that is actually javascript code. When a webpage that has a codeimage is loaded, the javascript code contained in the 
        image is extracted and run. It is a novel way to distribute your code and your code won't be immediately viewable to curious eyes.<br />
        <br />
        A codeimage can contain javascript and/or images. The intent is to have all the code and art assets of a project packaged up in a single 
        object. Javascript code compressed to about 1/3 the original size in a codeimage, however images do not compress at all and, in fact, may
        be a useless feature. <br />
        <br />
        The function to decode the codeimage and launch the resulting code is about 700 bytes. Decoding large images can be rather slow on older 
        machines. I currently have one project that contains 40kb of javascript encoded in a 20kb PNG.<br />
        <br />
        If you want to try out the encoding yourself, <a href="codeimage.html">go here and try it</a>
